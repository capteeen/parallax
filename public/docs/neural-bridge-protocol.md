### Initialization Protocol
```typescript
async function initializeNeuralBridge() {
  await quantumEntanglementSetup({
    coherence: 0.9999,
    qubits: 1024,
    synapticMapping: true
  });
  
  return new NeuralBridge({
    bandwidth: "10TB/s",
    latency: "0.1ms",
    errorCorrection: "quantum"
  });
}
```
