# Emergency Protocols

## Overview
Critical safety procedures and emergency protocols for neural bridge operations. These protocols ensure the safety and integrity of both human consciousness and quantum systems during critical situations.

## Emergency Response Hierarchy

### Level 1: Warning
- Minor system fluctuations
- Non-critical performance issues
- Automated recovery possible

### Level 2: Alert
- Significant performance degradation
- Pattern synchronization issues
- Manual intervention recommended

### Level 3: Critical
- System stability compromised
- Consciousness stream interruption risk
- Immediate action required

### Level 4: Emergency
- Severe system failure
- Direct consciousness safety risk
- Emergency shutdown mandatory

## Critical Protocols

### 1. Quantum Decoherence Prevention
```typescript
// Automatic decoherence detection and prevention
async function preventDecoherence() {
  const coherenceLevel = await quantum.measureCoherence();
  
  if (coherenceLevel < 0.9990) {
    await quantum.activateBackupEntanglement();
    await neural.reduceLoad();
    notifyOperators("DECOHERENCE_RISK");
  }
}
```

### 2. Neural Load Balancing
```typescript
// Dynamic load distribution across neural pathways
function balanceNeuralLoad() {
  const currentLoad = neural.getCurrentLoad();
  const threshold = 0.80; // 80% capacity
  
  if (currentLoad > threshold) {
    neural.redistributeLoad();
    activateBackupSystems();
  }
}
```

### 3. Emergency Shutdown Sequence
```typescript
// Graceful system shutdown procedure
async function emergencyShutdown() {
  // 1. Secure consciousness stream
  await consciousness.secure();
  
  // 2. Disconnect quantum bridge
  await quantum.disconnect();
  
  // 3. Save neural state
  await neural.backup();
  
  // 4. Power down systems
  await system.shutdown();
}
```
